        <h1 class="text-center font-semibold text-2xl text-green-700 uppercase mb-4 mt-4"> Scope of var, let, and
            const...</h1>

        <p class="text-sm mb-3">
            In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let, and const. In this article,
            we will see the differences between the var, let, and const keywords. We will discuss the scope and other
            required concepts about each keyword.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base mb-2">
            <span class="text-green-500 underline">JavaScript var keyword:</span> The var is the oldest keyword to
            declare a variable in JavaScript. <br>

            <span class="text-green-500 underline">Scope:</span> Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var
            keyword is the global or function scope. It
            means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a
            particular function can be accessed within the function.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base mb-2">
            <span class="text-green-500 underline">JavaScript let keyword:</span> The let keyword is an improved version
            of the var keyword. <br>

            <span class="text-green-500 underline">Scope:</span> The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It
            can’t be accessible outside the
            particular block ({block}). Let’s see the below example.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
            <span class="text-green-500 underline">const keyword in JavaScript:</span> The const keyword has all the
            properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it. <br>

            <span class="text-green-500 underline">Scope:</span> When users declare a const variable, they need to
            initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is
            declared.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-center font-semibold text-2xl text-green-700 uppercase mb-4 mt-4"> The use cases of null and
            undefined</h1>

        <p>
            The <b>null</b> keyword in JavaScript is a falsy data type that denotes that the data type is null. Falsy type
            refers to the coercion of null to false during conditional statement executions.

            <b>Null</b> is an object in JavaScript and represents primitive data types. A null value in JavaScript is used for
            referring absence of any object value and if any function or variable returns null, then we can infer that
            the object could not be created. If we pass null as the default parameter to any function type it would take
            the ‘null’ as a value passed to it.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            <b>Undefined </b>is a type of Data type in JavaScript. When a variable is declared and not initialized or not
            assigned with any value. By default, the variable was stored with an Undefined value.

            <b>Undefined</b> is a global read-only variable that represents the value Undefined. Undefined is a type of
            primitive type
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-center font-semibold text-2xl text-green-700 uppercase mb-4 mt-4">What is a REST API?</h1>
        <p>
            An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. <br>
            A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.
